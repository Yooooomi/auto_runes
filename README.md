# Autorunes

Autorunes is a program that scraps mobafire guides to create automatically your runes pages.

You can use the standalone Windows application by pasting the guide link into it or use the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autorunes/pefheflffhfnmoeiamhofclgpcolppnc) to be able to create the rune page by one click from the guide page !

# Prerequisites

- The League of Legends launcher must be launched in order for the runes to be made
- The [Autorunes extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autorunes/pefheflffhfnmoeiamhofclgpcolppnc) if you want to build runes pages directly from the browser

# Installation

1) Grab the installer in the [`releases`](https://github.com/Yooooomi/auto_runes/releases) page of this Github
2) Install the application

# Usage

## Native Application

> Note that you have to be either in a champ select or in a rune page in the __Collection__ tab of your profile for the application to work

1) Start the native application by searching for _Autorunes_ in your start menu
2) Paste the guide link into the input
3) Click the __Build__ button to build your rune page

## Chrome extension

> Of course, the native application has to be installed on the computer for the extension to work, the extension just communicates to the core _Autorune_ application

1) Navigate to a Mobafire build using Google Chrome
2) Then click the green __Autorunes__ icon in the top right corner of your browser

> Note that clicking the icon will always have the __in champ select__ behaviour, if you want to build a rune page in your profile page, just right click on the page and select __Not in a game fill__
